# Pagila

> Fork is based on **Pagila version 3.1.0**.

> Pagila has been tested against **PostgreSQL 12 and above**.

Pagila started as a port of the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) example database available for MySQL, which was originally developed by Mike Hillyer of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, etc.

All the tables, data, views, and functions have been ported; some of the changes made were:

- Changed `char(1)` true/false fields to proper `boolean` fields
- The `last_update` columns were set with triggers to update them
- Added foreign keys
- Removed `DEFAULT 0` on foreign keys since it's pointless with real FK's
- Used PostgreSQL built-in fulltext searching for fulltext index. Removed the need for the `film_text` table.
- The `rewards_report` function was ported to a simple SRF
- Added `JSONB` data

**Fulltext functionality** is built in PostgreSQL, so parts of the schema exist in the main schema file. Example usage:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE fulltext @@ to_tsquery('fate&india');
```

The `payment` table is designed as a **partitioned table** with a 7 month timespan for the date ranges.

## Create the database

### Using Docker
1. **Create the database**:

```bash
docker pull postgres:17.5

docker run --name pagila \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=javosw \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=122333 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=pagila \
  -p 5401:5432 \
  -d postgres:17.5
```

1. **Create all schema objects** (tables, etc):

```bash
docker exec -i pagila psql -U javosw -d pagila < ./sql/main/pagila-schema.sql
```

3. **Insert all data**:

```bash
docker exec -i pagila psql -U javosw -d pagila < ./sql/main/pagila-data.sql
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. **Run**:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## **Enter the database**

**Option 1**:
```bash
docker exec -it pagila psql -U javosw -d pagila
```

**Option 2**:
```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5401 -U javosw -d pagila
```

**Done!** You're in.
```

Type "help" for help.

## Installation notes

### Loading Data Files
The `pagila-data.sql` file and the `pagila-insert-data.sql` both contain the same data, the former using `COPY` commands (**faster** for bulk loading), the latter using `INSERT` commands (**slower**), so **you only need to install one of them**. Both formats are provided for those who have trouble using one version or another, and for instructors who want to point out the longer data loading time with the latter. You can load them via `psql`.

### Loading JSONB Files
* Schema (plain SQL):
  * `sql/dump/pagila-schema-jsonb.sql`

* Data (**binary dump**, not plain SQL):
  * `sql/dump/pagila-data-yum-jsonb.sql`
  * `sql/dump/pagila-data-apt-jsonb.sql`
  * `sql/dump/pagila-insert-data_yum-jsonb.sql`
  * `sql/dump/pagila-insert-data_apt-jsonb.sql`

JSONB dumps are large and complex. To reduce GitHub repo size and retain full structure, they were exported in **custom format** using `pg_dump --format=custom`.

Use `pg_restore` when the file is a **binary dump**. You can still use **`psql`** to load **`pagila-schema-jsonb.sql`**, **however** please **use `pg_restore` to load `jsonb` data files**:

```bash
docker exec -i pagila psql -U javosw -d pagila < ./sql/dump/pagila-schema-jsonb.sql

docker exec -i pagila pg_restore --no-owner -U javosw -d pagila < ./sql/dump/pagila-data-apt-jsonb.sql
```

## pgAdmin
pgAdmin is included in the `docker-compose.yml`.

Navigate to the URL: [`http://localhost:5402/`](http://localhost:5402/)
- Default Username: `admin@admin.com`
- Default Password: `122333`

## Sample query

```sql
-- total revenue generated by each film category
WITH
  cte_revenue_by_film_category AS (
    SELECT
      film_category.category_id,
      SUM(payment.amount) AS total_revenue
    FROM
      film_category
      JOIN film ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
      JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
      JOIN rental ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
      JOIN payment ON payment.rental_id = rental.rental_id
      JOIN category ON category.category_id = film_category.category_id
    GROUP BY
      film_category.category_id
  )
SELECT
  category.name AS category_name,
  cte.total_revenue
FROM
  cte_revenue_by_film_category AS cte
  JOIN category ON category.category_id = cte.category_id
ORDER BY
  cte.total_revenue DESC;
```
